AutoID Analyses Platform
========================

This prototype has been developed in the context of a university class and alongside with four RFID projects conducted at a primary school.
Its aim is to explore the possible analyses with regard to the data that those projects collect.

It is a Web platform mainly built with `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com>`_ and `Highcharts <http://www.highcharts.com>`_.

Since it is so far tested with example data only, it neither protects the stakeholders' privacy to a sufficient extend, nor is it optimized for huge data sets.

The main use for this repository is for follow-up projects.

Feel free to `request <mailto:autoid_analyses@lukas-pirl.de>`_ a report that describes this project in more detail.
Of course, any other questions are welcome as well.
